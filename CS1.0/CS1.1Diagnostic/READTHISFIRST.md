# Monster Dance Battle

We are super excited for you to join Makeschool this Fall! [Check out this wecome video from Jess](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mHvZTZw1d5tfB5gWHDBA7h2r771mQ7zY/view?usp=sharing)

This is small Python project that you will complete to help us know what Computer Science classes will best support your needs. This project will have you complete a command line turn based game where Monsters will perform a dance battle! To see a sample of a completed project running check out this video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jd92L2xJWVUTl-vu441QP708fcFYTsHN/view?usp=sharing).

Complete this project if you have previous experience coding. If you don't have previous experience or you find that this project is too difficult, that is totally okay! Our classes are designed to teach you these skills. This project helps us guage your current experience level so that we can identify who might be able to place out of intro level material. Skip this if the material is too challenging right now. 

This project has two parts, the first part will give you an opportunity to showcase your skills related to programming fundamentals (CS 1.0). The second part is optional and will give you the opportunity to showcase your skills related to Object Oriented Programming (CS 1.1). You can defntely just complete the first part if you are not comfortable with Object Oriented Programming just yet. 

Part 1 will be done in main.py. All instructions to complete the project functions will be given in the form of TODO: comments. 

Part 2 is optional and will be a refactor of main.py to use objects that whose classes you will define in Monster.py and UltraMonster.py.

Have fun with this project and don't be afraid to express yourself. If you get stuck don't hesitate to reach out and ask clarifying questions! My email is jess.dahmen@makeschool.com

# Submission Instructions

To submit this project for evaluation fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/4Xz4S5b5rSHhyjRm9) with your information.

In your submission also include a short screen capture video of you explaning your code like you would if you were demoing a project in class (you don't need to live code, just finish your work and then make the video). 

[Here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721) are some instructions about how to use Quicktime to record a video.

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15lIYzwoGzFuy9xfkdlWOjr768HYRtyW8/view?usp=sharing) is a short example video of how I would explain a small project I worked on. Focus on explaining how you solved the problem and what coding constructs you used and how they work. These videos don't need to be perfect or edited so don't stress if you don't have much experience creating videos, we just want to see your thought process.
