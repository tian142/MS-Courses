                <p>Tian is a value-driven computer science student at MakeSchool. Tian was previously an auditor with an accounting degree from the University of California, Santa Barbara<abbr>(UCSB)</abbr>. Throughout his time studying and working in the accounting industry, Tian realized that he has several ideas that could solve frequent problems in his life and the lives of people around him.  Tian was(and still is) excited to bring his ideas to life. However, he was not able to work on them due to a lack of coding skills and working at a demanding day job.</p> 

                <p>After five months of working as an auditor, Tian decided that he would go back to school to pursue what he found could bring meaning to his life - to create projects and platforms that can solve problems and reduce suffering in the world. Tian recently just started as a junior at MakeSchool and is thrilled to work towards his potential. </p>
